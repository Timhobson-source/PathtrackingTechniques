# PathtrackingTechniques

A pathtracking techinique for soling systems of equations I researched for my dissertation, implemented in python. 

The method used involves creating a homotopy between the images of a polynomial system, f(x1,...,xn)=(f1,f2,...,fn), whose roots (solutions to f=0) we want to find and a similar polynomial system, g, with the same number of roots as f, whose roots we already know. I refer you to the text by Daniel J. Bates et al, "Numerically Solving Polynomial Systems with Bertini", for a complete mathematical description of the methods implemented here. Note: In this method we require dim(f) = number of variables. n
