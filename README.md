# PathtrackingTechniques
Various pathtracking techiniques implemented.

- newton.py: simple definitions of Newton's method applied to single variable equations to be later used

- single_variable_pathtracking.py: code for and example of single variable pathtracking, solutions verified via newton's method.

- multi_variable_pathtracking.py: code for, and example of, pathtracking for a system of 2 variables and 2 equations (prerequisite for pathtracking is no. of variables=system dimesnion).

- pathtracking3.pdf: this is a pdf publish of multi_variable_pathtracking.py in a jupyter notebook.

- multi_variable_pathtracking_with_symbolic_tools: same as multi_variable_pathtracking.py except it uses symbolic tools to allow for a easier alternation of the system of equations.
